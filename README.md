# Backend meeting - RxJS

There is an API for the Magic Number. You can fetch it from `http://127.0.0.1:3005/api`.

TODO list:
- [ ] We want to always see current Magic Number. **Every 5 second fetch Magic Number from API and print it.**
- [ ] **Remove the 5 seconds delay on start of program.**
- [ ] That's too many lines of output. **Only print the Magic Number when it is changed.**
- [ ] Magic Numbers over 100 are dangerous. **Stop watching Magic Numbers when you encounter value over 100.**
- [ ] Bonus: **Fetch current Magic Number on keyboard shortcut**
